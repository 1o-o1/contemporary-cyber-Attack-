#A Deep Learning Method for Detecting synthetic contemporary cyber Attack behaviours convolutional neural network
Several research on inner threat detection and associated topics were proposed to address this problem.
Several research were conducted in order to improve the conceptual knowledge of in-
sider threats. However, there are numerous limitations, including a lack of real-world
examples, biases in drawing conclusions, which are a big issue and remain unclear, as
well as the lack of a study that examines insider threats from a variety of viewpoints
and focuses on theoretical, technical, and statistical aspects. This project aims to
solve the problem of real-time anomaly detection. It has analyzed the most up-to-
date Methods for detecting anomalies in big data, as well as studies network traffic
and sensory measurements in real time of associated machine learning algorithms and
locate cyber-attacks.
